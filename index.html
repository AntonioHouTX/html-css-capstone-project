    <h2>Manual Movement</h2>
    <p>Historically, watches were wound by hand.  This was a cumbersome process that occasionally led to overwinding, causing the watch to become inoperable.</p>
    <h2>Automatic Movement</h2>
    <p>In 1926, Fortis introduced the first wristwatch with an automatic winding rotor, thus eliminating the need to constantly wind the watch by hand.  Rolex refers to the automatic movement on its watches as the perpetual movement.</p>
    <h2>The Quartz Movement Revolution</h2>
    <p>The history of quartz watches dates back to the 1970s when the first quartz watches were released by Seiko. Before the development of quartz watches, Swiss watch manufacturers dominated the industry, producing watch movements that required elite skill and craftsmanship undertaken by highly trained individuals. Quartz simplified the creation of watches by replacing complex movements and machinery which not only made timepieces more affordable but also made them more accurate.</p>
